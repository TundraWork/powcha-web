# PoWCHA-web

PoWCHA-web is the frontend codebase for PoWCHA.

This is essentially a fork of [ALTCHA](https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha) with some modifications and a different branding.

Please see the [PoWCHA](https://github.com/TundraWork/powcha) repository for the server-side codebase.

Please go to the upstream repository for more information on the original project.
